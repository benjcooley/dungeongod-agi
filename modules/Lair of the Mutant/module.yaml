      - She is too large to move beyond these chambers and relies
          on the attendance of her workforce.

      **ANT QUEEN SUPPORT**

      - The  Ant Queen can call upon aid from her army of Ants
          each turn. The  level of support will depend upon the
          players actions to this point and how many Giant Ants
          have been eliminated in the process.
      - **Each turn roll a d6,** on a result of a 1-2 a new Giant Ant
          or Fire Ant answers the Ant Queen's summons. If the

          then reduce this to change 1 on a d6.
      - Limit the number of additional Ants that appear to 10.

        deathly looking man; **starlight gem** (iridescent gem, 500
        sp) and a **golden staff head** (250 sp) with a **second**
        **starlight gem** (500 sp) in its centre.
